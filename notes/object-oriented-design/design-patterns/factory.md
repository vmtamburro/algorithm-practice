The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be instantiated. This pattern is useful when you need to centralize the creation of objects, decouple the client code from the concrete classes it uses, and provide a way to extend or modify the object creation process.

### Example of Factory Pattern:

Let's consider a scenario where we have a pizza restaurant application that needs to create different types of pizzas.

#### Step 1: Define the Product Interface

```csharp
// Product Interface: Pizza
public interface Pizza
{
    void Prepare();
    void Bake();
    void Cut();
    void Box();
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Products (Different Types of Pizzas)

```csharp
// Concrete Product 1: CheesePizza
public class CheesePizza : Pizza
{
    public void Prepare()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Preparing Cheese Pizza");
    }

    public void Bake()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Baking Cheese Pizza");
    }

    public void Cut()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cutting Cheese Pizza");
    }

    public void Box()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Boxing Cheese Pizza");
    }
}

// Concrete Product 2: PepperoniPizza
public class PepperoniPizza : Pizza
{
    public void Prepare()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Preparing Pepperoni Pizza");
    }

    public void Bake()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Baking Pepperoni Pizza");
    }

    public void Cut()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cutting Pepperoni Pizza");
    }

    public void Box()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Boxing Pepperoni Pizza");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Factory Interface

```csharp
// Factory Interface: PizzaFactory
public interface PizzaFactory
{
    Pizza CreatePizza();
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement Concrete Factories (Different Types of Pizza Factories)

```csharp
// Concrete Factory 1: CheesePizzaFactory
public class CheesePizzaFactory : PizzaFactory
{
    public Pizza CreatePizza()
    {
        return new CheesePizza();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory 2: PepperoniPizzaFactory
public class PepperoniPizzaFactory : PizzaFactory
{
    public Pizza CreatePizza()
    {
        return new PepperoniPizza();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Client Code to Use the Factory Pattern

```csharp
public class Client
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a CheesePizza using CheesePizzaFactory
        PizzaFactory cheesePizzaFactory = new CheesePizzaFactory();
        Pizza cheesePizza = cheesePizzaFactory.CreatePizza();

        // Use the pizza object
        cheesePizza.Prepare();
        cheesePizza.Bake();
        cheesePizza.Cut();
        cheesePizza.Box();

        Console.WriteLine();

        // Create a PepperoniPizza using PepperoniPizzaFactory
        PizzaFactory pepperoniPizzaFactory = new PepperoniPizzaFactory();
        Pizza pepperoniPizza = pepperoniPizzaFactory.CreatePizza();

        // Use the pizza object
        pepperoniPizza.Prepare();
        pepperoniPizza.Bake();
        pepperoniPizza.Cut();
        pepperoniPizza.Box();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Product (`Pizza`)**: Defines the interface for the objects that the factory will create (`Prepare`, `Bake`, `Cut`, `Box`).
- **Concrete Products (`CheesePizza`, `PepperoniPizza`)**: Implements the `Pizza` interface to define specific types of pizzas with their own implementation of `Prepare`, `Bake`, `Cut`, and `Box` methods.
- **Factory Interface (`PizzaFactory`)**: Declares a method `CreatePizza` that returns an object of type `Pizza`.
- **Concrete Factories (`CheesePizzaFactory`, `PepperoniPizzaFactory`)**: Implement the `PizzaFactory` interface to create instances of `CheesePizza` and `PepperoniPizza` respectively.
- **Client Code (`Main` method)**: Demonstrates how the Factory Pattern decouples the client code (`Client` class) from the concrete classes (`CheesePizza`, `PepperoniPizza`) by allowing it to work with instances of `Pizza` through the common `PizzaFactory` interface. Depending on the factory used (`CheesePizzaFactory` or `PepperoniPizzaFactory`), different types of pizzas are created and manipulated without the client needing to know the specific details of how each pizza is created.

### Benefits of Factory Pattern:

- **Decouples Object Creation**: Client code does not need to know the specific concrete classes it uses, only the interface.
- **Centralizes Object Creation**: All object creation logic is centralized in the factory classes, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.
- **Supports Open/Closed Principle**: Easily extendable by adding new types of products (pizzas) or factories without modifying existing client code.

The Factory Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where there are multiple variants of a product (like different types of pizzas) and the specific type of object creation is determined at runtime based on certain conditions or inputs.
