### AVL Trees

AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. It was the first such data structure to be invented.

#### Key Properties:

1. **Balance Factor**: For every node in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most 1. This difference is known as the balance factor.

2. **Self-Balancing**: Whenever an insertion or deletion operation causes the tree to become unbalanced (i.e., violates the AVL property), rotations are performed to restore balance.

3. **Height-Balanced**: Due to the balancing property, the height of an AVL tree containing \( n \) nodes is always \( O(\log n) \), making operations like search, insert, and delete efficient.

#### Operations:

- **Insertion**: After inserting a node, the tree might become unbalanced. Depending on the balance factor of nodes along the insertion path, one or more rotations (single or double rotations) are performed to restore balance.

- **Deletion**: Similar to insertion, after deleting a node, the tree might become unbalanced. Rotations are performed to restore balance, ensuring the AVL properties are maintained.

- **Search**: Searching in an AVL tree is similar to a binary search tree, taking advantage of the sorted order of nodes based on their values.

#### Benefits:

- **Guaranteed Performance**: Operations like insertion, deletion, and search have \( O(\log n) \) time complexity in AVL trees, making them suitable for applications requiring efficient dynamic sets.

- **Automatic Balancing**: The AVL tree structure ensures that no subtree ever differs in height by more than one level, maintaining a balanced state after every modification operation.

#### Limitations:

- **Complexity**: Implementing and maintaining AVL trees can be more complex compared to simpler data structures like binary search trees (BSTs).

- **Overhead**: AVL trees may require additional storage for balance factors or parent pointers, depending on the implementation.

#### When to Use:

- AVL trees are useful in scenarios where frequent insertions, deletions, and searches are required, and maintaining a balanced tree structure with predictable performance is crucial.

AVL trees provide efficient dynamic set operations with guaranteed logarithmic time complexity, making them a powerful data structure for various applications in computer science and software engineering.
