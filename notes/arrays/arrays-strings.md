# Arrays and Strings Summary

## Key Concepts

- **Hash Tables**:
    -  Data structure that maps key-value pairs where each key is unique
    - Hash Function maps the keys to indices in an array called a has table
    - Implementation
        - Array: Hash table is typically implemented using an array of linked lists.
        - Hash Function: Converts keys into indices in the array.
    - Operations
        - Insertion: Insert a key-value pair into the hash table
        - Lookup: Find the value associated with a given key.
        - Deletion: Remove a key-value pair from the hash table.
    

- **Arrays**:
  - Collection of elements identified by index.
  - Fixed size and stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Strings**:
  - Sequences of characters.
  - Immutable in most programming languages.

## Common Operations and Techniques

- **Traversal and Manipulation**:
  - Iterating through arrays and strings to perform various operations.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**:
  - Utilizing two indices to traverse arrays or strings.
- **String Manipulation**:
  - Using built-in functions for concatenation, splitting, and searching.

## Example Problems

- **Is Unique**: Determine if a string has all unique characters.
- **Check Permutation**: Check if one string is a permutation of another.
- **URLify**: Replace all spaces in a string with "%20".
- **Palindrome Permutation**: Check if a string can form a palindrome.
- **One Away**: Determine if two strings are one edit away from each other.
- **String Compression**: Compress a string using counts of repeated characters.
- **Rotate Matrix**: Rotate an NxN matrix by 90 degrees.
- **Zero Matrix**: Set entire rows and columns of a matrix to zero.
- **String Rotation**: Check if one string is a rotation of another.

## Practical Tips

- **Understand String Immutability**: Manipulating strings can be costly due to immutability.
- **Consider Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings.
- **Optimal Solutions**: Aim for solutions with optimal time and space complexity.

Mastering these concepts and practicing related problems will enhance your ability to solve array and string questions effectively in coding interviews.
