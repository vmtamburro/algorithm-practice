Question 1.

Which of these is the Worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort - and cannot be expressed in lower order te\rms ?

- (a) O(n)
- (b) O(n log n)
- (c) O(n2)
- (d) O(n3)
- (e) O(log n)

Answer - C O(n2). The worst-case time complexity of quick sort occurs when the pivot selection consistently divides the array in an unbalanced manner, leading to an o(n2) time complexity.

Question 2.

Which of these is the worst case time complexity of Merge Sort - and cannot be expressed in lower order terms ?
- (a) O(n)
- (b) O(n log n)
- (c) O(n2)
- (d) O(n3)
- (e) O(log n)


Question 3.

Which of these is the average case time complexity of Merge Sort - and cannot be expressed in lower order terms ?

(a) O(n)
(b) O(n log n)
(c) O(n2)
(d) O(n3)
(e) O(log n)

Question 4.

Which of these is the time complexity involved in building a heap of n elements - and cannot be expressed in lower order terms ?

(a) O(n)
(b) O(n log n)
(c) O(n2)
(d) O(n3)
(e) O(log n)

Question 5.

A heap is a particular kind of a binary search tree. This statement is:
(a) True
(b) False

Question 6.

The Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shortest path algorithm for finding the shortest distances between nodes in a graph is an example of:
(a) A Dynamic Programming formulation.
(b) A Greedy Algorithm
(c) A recursion based divide and conquer technique.

Question 7.

A bitwise operation 'f' has an interesting characteristic, such that, if f(a,b) = c, it always turns out to be the case that f(b,a) = c; f(a,c) = b; f(c,a) = b; f(b,c) = a; f(c,b) = a. Which of these functions could 'f' possibly be?
(a) f(a,b) = a XOR b
(b) f(a,b) = a + b
(c) f(a,b) = a - b
(d) f(a,b) = a * b

(where a and b are the binary representations of any two non-negative integers)

Question 8.

A union find data-structure is commonly applied while implementing:
(a) A depth-first search traversal of a graph.
(b) A breadth-first search traversal of a graph.
(c) Computing the minimum spanning tree of a graph using the Kruskal algorithm.
(d) Computing the all-pairs shortest path in a graph.

Question 9.

Which of these is the worst case time complexity for looking up a key in a binary search tree - and cannot be expressed in lower order terms ?

(a) O(n)
(b) O(n log n)
(c) O(n2)
(d) O(n3)
(e) O(log n)

Question 10.

The graph algorithm which forms an essential component of the 'make' or 'ant build' used by programmers and software developers is:

(a) Flow maximization algorithm
(b) Shortest path algorithm
(c) Minimum spanning tree algorithm
(d) Bipartite matching
(e) Topological sort
