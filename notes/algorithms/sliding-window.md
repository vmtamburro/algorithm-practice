# Sliding Window Algorithm

The sliding window algorithm is a useful technique for solving problems that involve working with a subset of data in a sequential manner. It is often used in problems that involve arrays or strings. The main idea is to maintain a window that slides over the data structure to keep track of a subset of elements and efficiently compute some property of that subset.

### Key Concepts

1. **Window Size:** The size of the window can be fixed or variable depending on the problem. 
2. **Sliding the Window:** Move the window one element at a time from the start to the end of the data structure.
3. **Updating State:** Update the state of the window as it slides over the data, often using a queue, deque, or other data structures to maintain the current state.

### Types of Sliding Window Problems

1. **Fixed Size Window:** The window size is predetermined and remains constant as it slides across the array or string.
2. **Variable Size Window:** The window size can change dynamically based on the conditions of the problem.

### Example Problems

1. **Fixed Size Window Example:** Find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.

2. **Variable Size Window Example:** Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Steps to Implement a Sliding Window Algorithm

1. **Initialize the Window:** Set up the initial window at the starting position.
2. **Slide the Window:** Move the window to the right, one element at a time.
3. **Update the State:** Update the state of the window based on the new element added and the old element removed.
4. **Compute Result:** Keep track of the result based on the current state of the window.

### Fixed Size Window Example

Let's solve the problem: **Find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.**

Here's an example of how to implement a sliding window algorithm in C# to solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.

### Problem: Maximum Sum of Subarray of Size `k`

Given an array of integers and a number `k`, find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

### Implementation in C#

```csharp
using System;

class SlidingWindow
{
    public static int MaxSumSubarray(int[] arr, int k)
    {
        int n = arr.Length;
        if (n < k)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid input: the array size is smaller than the subarray size.");
            return -1;
        }

        // Compute the sum of the first window of size k
        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        {
            maxSum += arr[i];
        }

        // Current window sum is initially the same as maxSum
        int windowSum = maxSum;

        // Slide the window from start to end in the array
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++)
        {
            // Subtract the element going out of the window and add the new element
            windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
            // Update maxSum if the new window sum is greater
            maxSum = Math.Max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
        int k = 3;
        int result = MaxSumSubarray(arr, k);
        Console.WriteLine("The maximum sum of a subarray of size " + k + " is: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize the Window:**
   - Calculate the sum of the first window of size `k`.

2. **Slide the Window:**
   - Start from the `k`th element and slide the window one element at a time.
   - For each new position, subtract the element that is going out of the window (i.e., the leftmost element of the previous window) and add the new element coming into the window.

3. **Update the State:**
   - Update the `maxSum` if the new window sum is greater than the current `maxSum`.

### Running the Code

When you run the code, it will output:
```
The maximum sum of a subarray of size 3 is: 24
```

This result is obtained from the subarray `[7, 8, 9]`, which has the maximum sum of 24.
