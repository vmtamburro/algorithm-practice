### Quick Sort Algorithm

Quick sort is a highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The subarrays are then sorted recursively.

### Key Concepts

1. **Pivot Selection:** Choose an element as the pivot. The choice of pivot can affect performance.
2. **Partitioning:** Rearrange elements such that elements less than the pivot come before it and elements greater than the pivot come after it.
3. **Recursive Sorting:** Recursively apply the same process to the subarrays.

### Steps to Implement Quick Sort

1. **Select Pivot:** Choose a pivot element.
2. **Partition the Array:** Rearrange elements around the pivot.
3. **Recursively Sort:** Apply quick sort to the subarrays formed by partitioning.

### Pseudocode

```text
quickSort(array, low, high)
    if low < high
        pivotIndex = partition(array, low, high)
        quickSort(array, low, pivotIndex - 1)
        quickSort(array, pivotIndex + 1, high)

partition(array, low, high)
    pivot = array[high]
    i = low - 1
    for j = low to high - 1
        if array[j] < pivot
            i = i + 1
            swap(array[i], array[j])
    swap(array[i + 1], array[high])
    return i + 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case:** O(n log n)
- **Average Case:** O(n log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2) (occurs when the pivot selection is poor, e.g., already sorted array with the smallest or largest element as pivot)

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) for the recursive stack space in the average case

### Implementation in C#

Here is a C# implementation of the quick sort algorithm:

```csharp
using System;

class QuickSort
{
    public static void Sort(int[] arr, int low, int high)
    {
        if (low < high)
        {
            int pivotIndex = Partition(arr, low, high);

            // Recursively sort elements before and after partition
            Sort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1);
            Sort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private static int Partition(int[] arr, int low, int high)
    {
        int pivot = arr[high];
        int i = low - 1;

        for (int j = low; j < high; j++)
        {
            if (arr[j] < pivot)
            {
                i++;
                // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Swap arr[i + 1] and arr[high] (pivot)
        int tempPivot = arr[i + 1];
        arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
        arr[high] = tempPivot;

        return i + 1;
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] arr = { 38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10 };
        Console.WriteLine("Unsorted array:");
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", arr));

        Sort(arr, 0, arr.Length - 1);

        Console.WriteLine("Sorted array:");
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", arr));
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Pivot Selection:** The last element is chosen as the pivot.
2. **Partitioning:** Elements less than the pivot are moved to the left, and elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right.
3. **Swapping:** The pivot is placed in its correct position, and the array is partitioned around it.
4. **Recursive Sorting:** The process is repeated for the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot.

### Example

Let's step through an example with the array `[38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]`.

#### Initial Call

- `arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]`
- `low = 0`, `high = 6`
- `pivot = 10`

#### Partition Step

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - `i = -1`
   - `j` iterates from `0` to `5`

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `arr[j] = 38`, not less than pivot, no swap, `i = -1`

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - `arr[j] = 27`, not less than pivot, no swap, `i = -1`

4. **Third Iteration:**
   - `arr[j] = 43`, not less than pivot, no swap, `i = -1`

5. **Fourth Iteration:**
   - `arr[j] = 3`, less than pivot, swap `arr[0]` and `arr[3]`, `i = 0`
   - `arr = [3, 27, 43, 38, 9, 82, 10]`

6. **Fifth Iteration:**
   - `arr[j] = 9`, less than pivot, swap `arr[1]` and `arr[4]`, `i = 1`
   - `arr = [3, 9, 43, 38, 27, 82, 10]`

7. **Swap Pivot:**
   - Swap `arr[2]` and `arr[6]` (pivot)
   - `arr = [3, 9, 10, 38, 27, 82, 43]`

8. **Pivot Index:**
   - `pivotIndex = 2`

#### Recursive Calls

- Left Subarray: `[3, 9]`
- Right Subarray: `[38, 27, 82, 43]`

Repeat the process for each subarray until the entire array is sorted.

### Final Result

After all recursive calls and partitioning steps, the sorted array will be:
```
[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
```

### Tips for Interview

- **Understand the Algorithm:** Make sure you can explain the key steps and how the partitioning works.
- **Pivot Selection:** Discuss different pivot selection strategies and their impact on performance.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Be prepared to discuss the time and space complexity of quick sort.
- **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases such as an already sorted array or an array with all identical elements.

Quick sort is efficient and commonly used, making it an important algorithm to understand for technical interviews.
