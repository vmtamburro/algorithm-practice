### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure to manage the depth-first exploration of nodes.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Graphs can be represented using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
   - Nodes (vertices) are connected by edges, which can be directed or undirected.

2. **Traversal Order**:
   - DFS starts from a source node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - There are three possible orders for visiting nodes in DFS:
     - **Pre-order**: Visit the current node before its children.
     - **In-order**: Visit the left child, then the current node, then the right child (specific to binary trees).
     - **Post-order**: Visit the children before the current node.

3. **Stack Usage**:
   - DFS uses an explicit stack (or the call stack in recursive implementations) to keep track of nodes to be visited.
   - Nodes are pushed onto the stack when visited and popped when all adjacent nodes have been explored.

4. **Visited Nodes**:
   - A boolean array or hash set (`visited`) is used to keep track of nodes that have already been visited to prevent cycles in graphs.

5. **Applications**:
   - **Graph Traversal**: Used to visit all nodes in a graph or search for specific nodes.
   - **Cycle Detection**: Detect cycles in a graph.
   - **Pathfinding**: Find paths between nodes.
   - **Topological Sorting**: Sort nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

#### Example Implementation:

Here's a simple example of DFS implementation in C# for a graph represented using adjacency lists:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Graph
{
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private List<int>[] adj; // Adjacency list representation of the graph

    // Constructor
    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        adj = new List<int>[V];
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            adj[i] = new List<int>();
        }
    }

    // Add an edge to the graph
    public void AddEdge(int v, int w)
    {
        adj[v].Add(w); // Add w to v's adjacency list
    }

    // Depth-First Search traversal from a given source vertex
    public void DFS(int v)
    {
        bool[] visited = new bool[V]; // Mark all vertices as not visited
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }

    // Recursive function to perform DFS traversal
    private void DFSUtil(int v, bool[] visited)
    {
        visited[v] = true; // Mark the current node as visited
        Console.Write(v + " "); // Print the current node

        // Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
        foreach (int n in adj[v])
        {
            if (!visited[n])
            {
                DFSUtil(n, visited);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Graph g = new Graph(4);
        g.AddEdge(0, 1);
        g.AddEdge(0, 2);
        g.AddEdge(1, 2);
        g.AddEdge(2, 0);
        g.AddEdge(2, 3);
        g.AddEdge(3, 3);

        Console.WriteLine("Depth-First Traversal starting from vertex 2:");
        g.DFS(2); // Output: 2 0 1 3
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of the Implementation:

- **Graph Class**:
  - Represents a graph using adjacency lists (`List<int>[] adj`).
  - Constructor initializes the number of vertices (`V`) and creates adjacency lists for each vertex.
  - `AddEdge` method adds an edge between two vertices.

- **DFS Method**:
  - `DFS(int v)` initializes the `visited` array and calls `DFSUtil` to perform DFS traversal from vertex `v`.
  - `DFSUtil(int v, bool[] visited)` is a recursive function that performs DFS traversal starting from vertex `v`.
  - It marks the current vertex as visited, prints it, and recursively visits all adjacent vertices that have not been visited.

- **Example Usage**:
  - Creates a `Graph` instance with 4 vertices and adds edges between them.
  - Calls `DFS(2)` to start DFS traversal from vertex 2 and prints the traversal path.

This implementation demonstrates how DFS can be used to traverse a graph and visit all reachable vertices, starting from a specified source vertex. Adjustments can be made for specific needs such as handling disconnected graphs, finding paths, or performing other operations during traversal.
