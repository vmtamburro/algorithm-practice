# Recommendation System

### 1. Understanding the Requirements
Functional Requirements
* Provide personalized recommendations for users
* Support multiple types of recommendations
  * Movies
  * Products
  * Music
  * Articles
* Handle real-time and batch processing
* Allow users to provide feedback (likes, dislikes, ratings)
* Scale to millions of users, and billions of interactions

Non-Functional Requirements
* Low-latency responses (~miliseconds)
* High availability and fault tolerance
* Scalable for large datasets
* Support both online (real-time) and offline (batch) processing
* Ensures fairness and avoid bias in recommendations

### 2. Types of Recommendation Systems
* Collabroative Filtering - Uses user-item interaction data
  * Users like you watched
* Content-based Filtering - Uses item attributes
  * Because you watched an action movie
* Hybrid Model - Combines both approaches for better accuracy
  * Netflix uses a mix of both
* Deep Learning-Based Recommendations - Uses neural networks for advanced personalization.

### 3. High-Level Architecture
Major Components
1. User Data Store - stores user profiles, preferences, and interactions
2. Item data store - stores product details (movies, products, songs)
3. Event Logging System - tracks user interactions (views, clicks, purchase)
4. Feature Engineering & Data Processing - Prepares data for training models
5. Model Training Pipeline - Trains models using Machine Learning (ML) techniques
6. Recommendation Engine - Generates Recommendations in real-time
7. Ranking & Personalization Service - Adjusts recommendations based on user context
8. Serving Layer (APIs, Cache, Search Engine) - Provides fast recommendations to users

### 4. Data Flow in the System
1. User interacts with the platform (views, clicks, purchases)
2. Events are logged in a real-time event system (Kafka, Kinesis)
3. Data processing via Apache Spark, Flink, or Beam
4. Feature Engineering & Model Training in TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn
5. Trained models are deployed to a Recommendation Engine
6. Real-time recommendations are served via APIs and caching (REdis, memached)

### 5. Scaling Considerations
* Sharding & Partitioning - Use consistent hashing to distribute data
* Caching - reduce latency using Redis, memached
* Load Balancing - Distribute requests across multiple recommnedation servers
* Batch & Stream Processing - Use Apache Spark for batch & Apache Flink/Kafka streams for real-time
* A/B Testing - Experiment with different recommendation Models

### 6. Technologies to use
* Data Storage - PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, Cassandra
* Event Processing - Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis
* ML Model Training - TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
* Data Processing - Apache Spark, Flink, Beam
* API & Serving - Fast API, gRPC, Flask
* Caching - Redis, Memached
* Deployment - Kubernetes, Docker
