# Design a Scalable ETL Pipeline

### 1. Understanding the Requirements
* Process large volumes of structured and unstructured data
  * Transction logs, customer data
* Handle real-time (streaming) and batch processing
* Ensure data quality, consistency, and reliability
* Optimize storage and retrieval for analytics & reporting
* Scale efficiently as data volume grows

### 2. High-Level Architecture
1. Data Ingestion Layer
  * Batch Processing: Use Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, or AWS Glue to schedule ETL Jobs
  * Stream Processing: Use Apache Kafka, AWS Kenisis, or Google Pub/Sub for real-time data ingestion
2. Data Transformation Layer
  * Apply schema validation, deduplication, filtering, and enrichment
  * Use apache beam, dbt, or pandas for transformation
3. Data Storage Layer
  * Raw Data Storage: use Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or HDFS for long-term raw storage.
  * Processed Data Storage: Store in a columnar database (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift) for fast analytics
  * Operational Database: Use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or NoSQL (Cassandra, DynamoDB) for querying
4. Data Serving Layer
  * Provide APIs (FastAPI, Flask, gRPC) for expsosing processed data
  * Use BI tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI) for data visualization


### 3. Scaling Considerations
* Parallel Processing - Distribute ETL jobs using Spark, Flink, or Dataflow
* Partitioning & Sharding - Store data efficiently in BigQuery, Snowflake
* Schema Evolution - Handle changes using Avro, Parquet, or Delta Lake
* Monitoring & Logging - Track performance using Prometheus, Grafono, Datadog.


### 4. Ensuring Fault Tolerance
* Retry Mechanism - implement automatic retries for failed tasks
* Checkpointing - use Spark Steaming  & Flink checkpointing to recover mid-stream failures
* Idempotent processing - ensure reprocessed data doesn't create duplciates (use event deduplication strategies)
* Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) - Route corrupted/failed records to S3, Kafka, DLQ or BigQuery error tables for later inspection
* Monitoring & Alerts - Use Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch to detect failures quickly

### 5. Cost Efficiency
* Use Spot/Preemptible instances - reduce costs by using AWS Spot Instances, GCP Preemptible VMs
* Optimize Storage Format - Store in Parquet/ORC instead of CSV to reduce read/write costs
* Serverless Solutions - Use AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Dataflow for event-driven processing (pay-per-use)
* Data Tiering - Move cold data to Glacier/Coldline Storage instead of keeping everything in hot storage

### 6. Schema Evolution
* Use Avro, Parquet, or Delta Lake - Formats support schema evolution natively
* Schema-on-Read - Instead of forcing a fixed schema, let consumers handle schema changes dynamically
* Versioning - Store schema versions in a metadata registry (e.g. Apache Hive Metastore, AWS Glue Data Catalog)
* Backfilling Strategies - Reproces historical data when schema updates require backward compatibility
* Automated Schema Validation - Use tools like Great Expectations to validate schema changes before ingestion

### 7. Late-arriving Data in Real-Time Streaming
* Event Time Processing - Use Watermarks in Apache Flink/Spark Structured Streaming to handle out-of-order events
* Stateful Windowing - Implement sliding/tumbling sessions to account for delayed data (e.g. 10-min grace period)
* Store Raw Data for Reprocessing - Keep logs in Kafka, S3, or Google Cloud Storage to reprocess Late Data
* Backfill Pipelines - Schedule a daily batch ETL to correct late-arriving records in downstream systems
* Hybrid Approach - Use a mix of real-time + batch ETL to ensure data consistency
