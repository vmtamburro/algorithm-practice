### Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph

**Problem Statement**:
Given a directed graph represented as an adjacency list, write a function to detect if there is a cycle in the graph. If a cycle exists, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

**Example**:
```
Graph:
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 0
3 -> 4

Expected Output: true (since there is a cycle: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0)
```
