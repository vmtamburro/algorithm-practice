### Interview Question: Find the Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph

**Problem Statement**:
Given an unweighted graph represented as an adjacency list and two vertices \( start \) and \( end \), write a function to find the shortest path between \( start \) and \( end \). If no path exists, return an empty list.

**Example**:
```
Graph:
0 - 1
| \ |
2 - 3
|   |
4 - 5

start = 0
end = 5

Expected Output: [0, 2, 4, 5]
```
